= omniauth-rails

THIS IS EARLY STAGE. PLEASE DON'T USE THIS IN YOUR PROJECTS YET.

This project contians the basic Rails constructs needed to set up an application to use OmniAuth. 

At this time, OmniAuth::Identity is supported and uses a model named Identity. 

gem 'omniauth-rails'
rails generate migration omniauth-rails-identity
rake db:migrate
rails server 
open 'http://localhost/auth/identity'
